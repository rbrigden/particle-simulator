# Particle Simulator
This program simulates charged particles in an environment with electromagnetic forces at play. 
Written using the Processing platform. 

# Download & Run
To run the simulator (right now in very primitive form) clone the repository into a local directory and navigate
into the app directory. Select one of the files labelled with your OS (Mac OSX, Windows 32-bit, or Windows 64-bit)
and unzip it. In the uncompressed directory, locate and run the file named 'simulator'. Enjoy the mesmerizing particles!
